# Lisk Smart Contract test app

## What is Lisk?

Properties:

1. JavaScript contracts
2. Runs on a Node.JS + Postgres
3. Uses DPoS consensus algorithm (see Bitshares)
4. Allows to create "custom blockchains" on top
5. Sidechains
6. Supported by Microsoft

******
> Every blockchain based crypto-currency to date, uses a consensus algorithm in order to determine who will generate the next block (and receive the reward).

**Proof of Delegates** is the consensus algorithm used by Lisk. It combines elements taken from the Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithms.

> Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, calls our type of blockchain a consortium blockchain.

101 top active delegates actually forge blocks (votes)
102-... all other do no voting
